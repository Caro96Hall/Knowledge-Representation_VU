Welcome to the course Knowledge Representation.
The questions of how to represent knowledge and how to reason with it, have played a central role ever since the early days of Artificial Intelligence.
This course will make you familiar with a number of important knowledge representation formalisms. For each formalism, the course will discuss the representational form, an inference mechanism, and an example application problem.

Covering the following core KR formalisms:

1. Propositional Logic and satisfiability checking with Davis Putnam

2. Graphical probabilistic models

3. Description logics for classification with Tableau calculi

Outomce: Students should be able to transfer the learned techniques to other problems and to other representation mechanisms.
