Welcome to the course Knowledge Representation. The questions of how to represent knowledge and how to reason with it, have played a central role ever since the early days of Artificial Intelligence. This course will make you familiar with a number of important knowledge representation formalisms. For each formalism, the course will discuss the representational form, an inference mechanism, and an example application problem.

In this yearâ€™s edition, we plan to cover the following core KR formalisms:

Propositional Logic and satisfiability checking with Davis Putnam;
Graphical probabilistic models.
Description logics for classification with Tableau calculi.
At the end of the course, students should be able to transfer the learned techniques to other problems and to other representation mechanisms.
